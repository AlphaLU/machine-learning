## Basic Classification Methods For Celestial Objects Classification
The notebook covers some basic regression techniques on the `Sloan Digital Sky Survey - DR18` dataset from Kaggle

Some of the concepts in the notebook:
- General description
- Features, their types and description
- Some data cleaning
- Charting
- Scaling
- Classifying objects

Here we're classifying celestial objects.
Such methods can help us automate much of the work done by humans but takes away the possibility for human error (we still need to pay attention to model errors!)

Note: It's not perfect and I'm sure there's a few things to fix in this notebook. If you spot any mistakes, incomplete information or have a suggestion that'll help me improve the content of the notebook, I'd be more than happy to receive your feedback!
