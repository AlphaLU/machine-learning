# Cancer Classification
In this notebook, we'll build a neural network using PyTorch to classify whether a cancer is Malignant or Benign.

This is one of the MANY applications of neural networks and as this is one of the first NN proejcts I've worked on, know that there are many things to improve within the notebook.

In this notebook we:
- Use Classes to organize tasks
- Get a quick overlook into the Cancer Data dataset 
- Scale data
- Build a Neural Network using PyTorch
- Train a Neural Network
- Achieve 99% accuracy!
